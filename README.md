# mtasa-crosshair-overlay
A crosshair overlay made using python for MTA. It was specifically made for the server CIT but can work for any with the correct key setup.

An example config is provided in config.ini
You can modify it to make it work for any server.

# Will this get me banned from MTA?
Well, not really. This program does not contain any injection or anything similar that infects MTA. It's just a simple program that relies on key presses.
So there is not really a risk of being banned as it is not a cheat and can not be used as a cheat.
However MTA Staff can simply decide they do not want this in their game and blacklist this program like they have done with some netlimiters, at that point I will not support this program and won't try to bypass their protection by anyway.
